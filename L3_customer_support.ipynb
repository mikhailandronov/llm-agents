Long-Term Memory Preserves valuable insights and learnings from past executions, allowing agents to build and refine their knowledge over time. Entity Memory Captures and organizes information about entities (people, places, concepts) encountered during tasks, facilitating deeper understanding and relationship mapping. Uses RAG for storing entity information. Contextual Memory Maintains the context of interactions by combining ShortTermMemory , LongTermMemory , and EntityMemory , aiding in the coherence and relevance of agent responses over a sequence of tasks or a conversation. External Memory Enables integration with external memory systems and providers (like Mem0), allowing for specialized memory storage and retrieval across different applications. Supports custom storage implementations for flexible memory management. User Memory ⚠️ DEPRECATED : This component is deprecated and will be removed in a future version. Please use External Memory instead.\\n\\u200b How Memory Systems Empower Agents\\nContextual Awareness : With short-term and contextual memory, agents gain the ability to maintain context over a conversation or task sequence, leading to more coherent and relevant responses.\\nExperience Accumulation : Long-term memory allows agents to accumulate experiences, learning from past actions to improve future decision-making and problem-solving.\\nEntity Understanding : By maintaining entity memory, agents can recognize and remember key entities, enhancing their ability to process and interact with complex information.\\n\\u200b Implementing Memory in Your Crew\\nWhen configuring a crew, you can enable and customize each memory component to suit the crew’s objectives and the nature of tasks it will perform.\\nBy default, the memory system is disabled, and you can ensure it is active by setting memory=True in the crew configuration.\\nThe memory will use OpenAI embeddings by default, but you can change it by setting embedder to a different model.\\nIt’s also possible to initialize the memory instance with your own instance.\\nThe ‘embedder’ only applies to Short-Term Memory which uses Chroma for RAG.\\nThe Long-Term Memory uses SQLite3 to store task results. Currently, there is no way to override these storage implementations.\\nThe data storage files are saved into a platform-specific location found using the appdirs package,\\nand the name of the project can be overridden using the CREWAI_STORAGE_DIR environment variable.\\n\\u200b Example: Configuring Memory for a Crew\\nCode from crewai import Crew , Agent , Task , Process\\n# Assemble your crew with memory capabilities\\nmy_crew = Crew (\\nagents = [ . . . ] ,\\ntasks = [ . . . ] ,\\nprocess = Process . sequential ,\\nmemory = True ,\\nverbose = True\\n)\\n\\u200b Example: Use Custom Memory Instances e.g FAISS as the VectorDB\\nCode from crewai import Crew , Process\\nfrom crewai . memory import LongTermMemory , ShortTermMemory , EntityMemory\\nfrom crewai . memory . storage . rag_storage import RAGStorage\\nfrom crewai . memory . storage . ltm_sqlite_storage import LTMSQLiteStorage\\nfrom typing import List , Optional\\n# Assemble your crew with memory capabilities\\nmy_crew : Crew = Crew (\\nagents = [ . . . ] ,\\ntasks = [ . . . ] ,\\nprocess = Process . sequential ,\\nmemory = True ,\\n# Long-term memory for persistent storage across sessions\\nlong_term_memory = LongTermMemory (\\nstorage = LTMSQLiteStorage (\\ndb_path = \"/my_crew1/long_term_memory_storage.db\"\\n)\\n) ,\\n# Short-term memory for current context using RAG\\nshort_term_memory = ShortTermMemory (\\nstorage = RAGStorage (\\nembedder_config = {\\n\"provider\" : \"openai\" ,\\n\"config\" : {\\n\"model\" : \\'text-embedding-3-small\\'\\n}\\n} ,\\ntype = \"short_term\" ,\\npath = \"/my_crew1/\"\\n)\\n) ,\\n) ,\\n# Entity memory for tracking key information about entities\\nentity_memory = EntityMemory (\\nstorage = RAGStorage (\\nembedder_config = {\\n\"provider\" : \"openai\" ,\\n\"config\" : {\\n\"model\" : \\'text-embedding-3-small\\'\\n}\\n} ,\\ntype = \"short_term\" ,\\npath = \"/my_crew1/\"\\n)\\n) ,\\nverbose = True ,\\n)\\n\\u200b Security Considerations\\nWhen configuring memory storage:\\nUse environment variables for storage paths (e.g., CREWAI_STORAGE_DIR )\\nNever hardcode sensitive information like database credentials\\nConsider access permissions for storage directories\\nUse relative paths when possible to maintain portability\\nExample using environment variables:\\nimport os\\nfrom crewai import Crew\\nfrom crewai . memory import LongTermMemory\\nfrom crewai . memory . storage . ltm_sqlite_storage import LTMSQLiteStorage\\n# Configure storage path using environment variable\\nstorage_path = os . getenv ( \"CREWAI_STORAGE_DIR\" , \"./storage\" )\\ncrew = Crew (\\nmemory = True ,\\nlong_term_memory = LongTermMemory (\\nstorage = LTMSQLiteStorage (\\ndb_path = \"{storage_path}/memory.db\" . format ( storage_path = storage_path )\\n)\\n)\\n)\\n\\u200b Configuration Examples\\n\\u200b Basic Memory Configuration\\nfrom crewai import Crew\\nfrom crewai . memory import LongTermMemory\\n# Simple memory configuration\\ncrew = Crew ( memory = True ) # Uses default storage locations\\nNote that External Memory won’t be defined when memory=True is set, as we can’t infer which external memory would be suitable for your case\\n\\u200b Custom Storage Configuration\\nfrom crewai import Crew\\nfrom crewai . memory import LongTermMemory\\nfrom crewai . memory . storage . ltm_sqlite_storage import LTMSQLiteStorage\\n# Configure custom storage paths\\ncrew = Crew (\\nmemory = True ,\\nlong_term_memory = LongTermMemory (\\nstorage = LTMSQLiteStorage ( db_path = \"./memory.db\" )\\n)\\n)\\n\\u200b Integrating Mem0 for Enhanced User Memory\\nMem0 is a self-improving memory layer for LLM applications, enabling personalized AI experiences.\\n\\u200b Using Mem0 API platform\\nTo include user-specific memory you can get your API key here and refer the docs for adding user preferences. In this case user_memory is set to MemoryClient from mem0.\\nCode import os\\nfrom crewai import Crew , Process\\nfrom mem0 import MemoryClient\\n# Set environment variables for Mem0\\nos . environ [ \"MEM0_API_KEY\" ] = \"m0-xx\"\\n# Step 1: Create a Crew with User Memory\\ncrew = Crew (\\nagents = [ . . . ] ,\\ntasks = [ . . . ] ,\\nverbose = True ,\\nprocess = Process . sequential ,\\nmemory = True ,\\nmemory_config = {\\n\"provider\" : \"mem0\" ,\\n\"config\" : { \"user_id\" : \"john\" } ,\\n\"user_memory\" : { } #Set user_memory explicitly to a dictionary, we are working on this issue.\\n} ,\\n)\\n\\u200b Additional Memory Configuration Options\\nIf you want to access a specific organization and project, you can set the org_id and project_id parameters in the memory configuration.\\nCode from crewai import Crew\\ncrew = Crew (\\nagents = [ . . . ] ,\\ntasks = [ . . . ] ,\\nverbose = True ,\\nmemory = True ,\\nmemory_config = {\\n\"provider\" : \"mem0\" ,\\n\"config\" : { \"user_id\" : \"john\" , \"org_id\" : \"my_org_id\" , \"project_id\" : \"my_project_id\" } ,\\n\"user_memory\" : { } #Set user_memory explicitly to a dictionary, we are working on this issue.\\n} ,\\n)\\n\\u200b Using Local Mem0 memory\\nIf you want to use local mem0 memory, with a custom configuration, you can set a parameter local_mem0_config in the config itself.\\nIf both os environment key is set and local_mem0_config is given, the API platform takes higher priority over the local configuration.\\nCheck this mem0 local configuration docs for more understanding.\\nIn this case user_memory is set to Memory from mem0.\\nCode from crewai import Crew\\n#local mem0 config\\nconfig = {\\n\"vector_store\" : {\\n\"provider\" : \"qdrant\" ,\\n\"config\" : {\\n\"host\" : \"localhost\" ,\\n\"port\" : 6333\\n}\\n} ,\\n\"llm\" : {\\n\"provider\" : \"openai\" ,\\n\"config\" : {\\n\"api_key\" : \"your-api-key\" ,\\n\"model\" : \"gpt-4\"\\n}\\n} ,\\n\"embedder\" : {\\n\"provider\" : \"openai\" ,\\n\"config\" : {\\n\"api_key\" : \"your-api-key\" ,\\n\"model\" : \"text-embedding-3-small\"\\n}\\n} ,\\n\"graph_store\" : {\\n\"provider\" : \"neo4j\" ,\\n\"config\" : {\\n\"url\" : \"neo4j+s://your-instance\" ,\\n\"username\" : \"neo4j\" ,\\n\"password\" : \"password\"\\n}\\n} ,\\n\"history_db_path\" : \"/path/to/history.db\" ,\\n\"version\" : \"v1.1\" ,\\n\"custom_fact_extraction_prompt\" : \"Optional custom prompt for fact extraction for memory\" ,\\n\"custom_update_memory_prompt\" : \"Optional custom prompt for update memory\"\\n}\\ncrew = Crew (\\nagents = [ . . . ] ,\\ntasks = [ . . . ] ,\\nverbose = True ,\\nmemory = True ,\\nmemory_config = {\\n\"provider\" : \"mem0\" ,\\n\"config\" : { \"user_id\" : \"john\" , \\'local_mem0_config\\' : config } ,\\n\"user_memory\" : { } #Set user_memory explicitly to a dictionary, we are working on this issue.\\n} ,\\n)\\n\\u200b Using External Memory\\nExternal Memory is a powerful feature that allows you to integrate external memory systems with your CrewAI applications. This is particularly useful when you want to use specialized memory providers or maintain memory across different applications.\\nSince it’s an external memory, we’re not able to add a default value to it - unlike with Long Term and Short Term memory.\\n\\u200b Basic Usage with Mem0\\nThe most common way to use External Memory is with Mem0 as the provider:\\nimport os\\nfrom crewai import Agent , Crew , Process , Task\\nfrom crewai . memory . external . external_memory import ExternalMemory\\nos . environ [ \"MEM0_API_KEY\" ] = \"YOUR-API-KEY\"\\nagent = Agent (\\nrole = \"You are a helpful assistant\" ,\\ngoal = \"Plan a vacation for the user\" ,\\nbackstory = \"You are a helpful assistant that can plan a vacation for the user\" ,\\nverbose = True ,\\n)\\ntask = Task (\\ndescription = \"Give things related to the user\\'s vacation\" ,\\nexpected_output = \"A plan for the vacation\" ,\\nagent = agent ,\\n)\\ncrew = Crew (\\nagents = [ agent ] ,\\ntasks = [ task ] ,\\nverbose = True ,\\nprocess = Process . sequential ,\\nexternal_memory = ExternalMemory (\\nembedder_config = { \"provider\" : \"mem0\" , \"config\" : { \"user_id\" : \"U-123\" } } # you can provide an entire Mem0 configuration\\n) ,\\n)\\ncrew . kickoff (\\ninputs = { \"question\" : \"which destination is better for a beach vacation?\" }\\n)\\n\\u200b Using External Memory with Custom Storage\\nYou can also create custom storage implementations for External Memory.

      "The crewAI framework introduces a sophisticated memory system designed to significantly enhance the capabilities of AI agents.\n",
      "This system comprises short-term memory , long-term memory , entity memory , and contextual memory , each serving a unique purpose in aiding agents to remember,\n",
      "reason, and learn from past interactions.\n",
      "​ Memory System Components\n",
      "Component Description Short-Term Memory Temporarily stores recent interactions and outcomes using RAG , enabling agents to recall and utilize information relevant to their current context during the current executions. Long-Term Memory Preserves valuable insights and learnings from past executions, allowing agents to build and refine their knowledge over time. Entity Memory Captures and organizes information about entities (people, places, concepts) encountered during tasks, facilitating deeper understanding and relationship mapping. Uses RAG for storing entity information. Contextual Memory Maintains the context of interactions by combining ShortTermMemory , LongTermMemory , and EntityMemory , aiding in the coherence and relevance of agent responses over a sequence of tasks or a conversation. External Memory Enables integration with external memory systems and providers (like Mem0), allowing for specialized memory storage and retrieval across different applications. Supports custom storage implementations for flexible memory management. User Memory ⚠️ DEPRECATED : This component is deprecated and will be removed in a future version. Please use External Memory instead.\n",
      "​ How Memory Systems Empower Agents\n",
      "Contextual Awareness : With short-term and contextual memory, agents gain the ability to maintain context over a conversation or task sequence, leading to more coherent and relevant responses.\n",
      "Experience Accumulation : Long-term memory allows agents to accumulate experiences, learning from past actions to improve future decision-making and problem-solving.\n",
      "Entity Understanding : By maintaining entity memory, agents can recognize and remember key entities, enhancing their ability to process and interact with complex information.\n",
      "​ Implementing Memory in Your Crew\n",
      "When configuring a crew, you can enable and customize each memory component to suit the crew’s objectives and the nature of tasks it will perform.\n",
      "By default, the memory system is disabled, and you can ensure it is active by setting memory=True in the crew configuration.\n",
      "The memory will use OpenAI embeddings by default, but you can change it by setting embedder to a different model.\n",
      "It’s also possible to initialize the memory instance with your own instance.\n",
      "The ‘embedder’ only applies to Short-Term Memory which uses Chroma for RAG.\n",
      "The Long-Term Memory uses SQLite3 to store task results. Currently, there is no way to override these storage implementations.\n",
      "The data storage files are saved into a platform-specific location found using the appdirs package,\n",
      "and the name of the project can be overridden using the CREWAI_STORAGE_DIR environment variable.\n",

      "### 1. Understanding CrewAI Memory\n",
      "\n",
      "CrewAI offers a sophisticated memory system designed to enhance your agents' capabilities by enabling them to remember past interactions, data, and context. This system includes:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Short-Term Memory:** Stores recent interactions temporarily, using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques.\n",
      "- **Long-Term Memory:** Preserves insights and learnings across sessions, stored in persistent databases like SQLite.\n",
      "- **Entity Memory:** Tracks and organizes information about entities (people, places, concepts) encountered during tasks.\n",
      "- **External Memory:** Allows integration with external providers or custom storage solutions for specialized or cross-application memory management.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. How to Enable and Configure Memory in Your Crew\n",
      "\n",
      "**Basic Setup:**\n",
      "\n",
      "- When creating your crew, set the `memory=True` parameter.\n",
      "- You can customize the memory components by providing specific configurations, such as embedding models, storage paths, or external providers.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Example: Basic Memory Activation**\n",

      "Hi Andrew,\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks so much for reaching out with your question about setting up a Crew and adding memory in CrewAI! I’m excited to help you get everything configured smoothly so your Crew can remember past interactions and improve performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here’s a comprehensive overview of how to add memory to your Crew in CrewAI, covering the different types of memory, how to enable and customize them, external providers, and best practices.\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. Understanding CrewAI Memory**\n",
      "\n",
      "CrewAI offers a versatile memory system that allows your agents to remember past interactions, data, and context, which can significantly enhance their capabilities. The main types include:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Short-Term Memory:** Temporarily stores recent interactions, often using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques.\n",
      "- **Long-Term Memory:** Preserves insights and data across sessions, stored in persistent databases like SQLite.\n",
      "- **Entity Memory:** Tracks and organizes information about entities (people, places, concepts) encountered during tasks.\n",
      "- **External Memory:** Integrates with external providers or custom storage solutions for specialized or cross-application memory management.\n",
      "\n",
      "For detailed info, you can check the [CrewAI Memory Documentation](https://crewai.com/docs/memory).\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. How to Enable and Configure Memory in Your Crew**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Basic Activation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "- When creating your Crew, set the `memory=True` parameter.\n",
      "- You can customize the memory components by providing specific configurations such as embedding models, storage paths, or external providers.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Example: Basic Memory Activation**\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "from crewai import Crew, Process\n",
      "\n",

      "    verbose=True\n",
      ")\n",
      "```\n",

       "\n",
       "Thanks so much for reaching out with your question about setting up a Crew and adding memory in CrewAI! I’m excited to help you get everything configured smoothly so your Crew can remember past interactions and improve performance.\n",
       "\n",
       "Here’s a comprehensive overview of how to add memory to your Crew in CrewAI, covering the different types of memory, how to enable and customize them, external providers, and best practices.\n",
       "\n",
       "**1. Understanding CrewAI Memory**\n",
       "\n",
       "CrewAI offers a versatile memory system that allows your agents to remember past interactions, data, and context, which can significantly enhance their capabilities. The main types include:\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Short-Term Memory:** Temporarily stores recent interactions, often using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques.\n",
       "- **Long-Term Memory:** Preserves insights and data across sessions, stored in persistent databases like SQLite.\n",
       "- **Entity Memory:** Tracks and organizes information about entities (people, places, concepts) encountered during tasks.\n",
       "- **External Memory:** Integrates with external providers or custom storage solutions for specialized or cross-application memory management.\n",
       "\n",
       "For detailed info, you can check the [CrewAI Memory Documentation](https://crewai.com/docs/memory).\n",
       "\n",
       "**2. How to Enable and Configure Memory in Your Crew**\n",
       "\n",
       "**Basic Activation:**\n",
       "\n",
       "- When creating your Crew, set the `memory=True` parameter.\n",
       "- You can customize the memory components by providing specific configurations such as embedding models, storage paths, or external providers.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Example: Basic Memory Activation**\n",

      "The crewAI framework introduces a sophisticated memory system designed to significantly enhance the capabilities of AI agents.\n",
      "This system comprises short-term memory , long-term memory , entity memory , and contextual memory , each serving a unique purpose in aiding agents to remember,\n",
      "reason, and learn from past interactions.\n",
      "​ Memory System Components\n",
      "Component Description Short-Term Memory Temporarily stores recent interactions and outcomes using RAG , enabling agents to recall and utilize information relevant to their current context during the current executions. Long-Term Memory Preserves valuable insights and learnings from past executions, allowing agents to build and refine their knowledge over time. Entity Memory Captures and organizes information about entities (people, places, concepts) encountered during tasks, facilitating deeper understanding and relationship mapping. Uses RAG for storing entity information. Contextual Memory Maintains the context of interactions by combining ShortTermMemory , LongTermMemory , and EntityMemory , aiding in the coherence and relevance of agent responses over a sequence of tasks or a conversation. External Memory Enables integration with external memory systems and providers (like Mem0), allowing for specialized memory storage and retrieval across different applications. Supports custom storage implementations for flexible memory management. User Memory ⚠️ DEPRECATED : This component is deprecated and will be removed in a future version. Please use External Memory instead.\n",
      "​ How Memory Systems Empower Agents\n",
      "Contextual Awareness : With short-term and contextual memory, agents gain the ability to maintain context over a conversation or task sequence, leading to more coherent and relevant responses.\n",
      "Experience Accumulation : Long-term memory allows agents to accumulate experiences, learning from past actions to improve future decision-making and problem-solving.\n",
      "Entity Understanding : By maintaining entity memory, agents can recognize and remember key entities, enhancing their ability to process and interact with complex information.\n",
      "​ Implementing Memory in Your Crew\n",
      "When configuring a crew, you can enable and customize each memory component to suit the crew’s objectives and the nature of tasks it will perform.\n",
      "By default, the memory system is disabled, and you can ensure it is active by setting memory=True in the crew configuration.\n",
      "The memory will use OpenAI embeddings by default, but you can change it by setting embedder to a different model.\n",
      "It’s also possible to initialize the memory instance with your own instance.\n",
      "The ‘embedder’ only applies to Short-Term Memory which uses Chroma for RAG.\n",
      "The Long-Term Memory uses SQLite3 to store task results. Currently, there is no way to override these storage implementations.\n",
      "The data storage files are saved into a platform-specific location found using the appdirs package,\n",
      "and the name of the project can be overridden using the CREWAI_STORAGE_DIR environment variable.\n",
      "​ Example: Configuring Memory for a Crew\n",
      "Code from crewai import Crew , Agent , Task , Process\n",
      "# Assemble your crew with memory capabilities\n",
      "my_crew = Crew (\n",
      "agents = [ . . . ] ,\n",
      "tasks = [ . . . ] ,\n",
      "process = Process . sequential ,\n",
      "memory = True ,\n",
      "verbose = True\n",

      "Здравствуйте, Алексей!\n",
      "\n",
      "Благодарю вас за обращение и интерес к возможностям CrewAI. Чтобы создать команду (Crew) и добавить в неё память, выполните следующие шаги:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Создание Crew с включенной памятью**  \n",
      "При инициализации Crew укажите параметр `memory=True`. Это активирует встроенную систему памяти, которая по умолчанию использует SQLite для долговременного хранения и встроенные эмбеддинги для краткосрочной памяти.\n",
      "\n",
      "Пример базовой настройки:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "from crewai import Crew, Process\n",
      "\n",
      "crew = Crew(\n",
      "    agents=[...],  # ваши агенты\n",
      "    tasks=[...],   # ваши задачи\n",
      "    process=Process.sequential,\n",
      "    memory=True,   # включение памяти\n",
      "    verbose=True\n",
      ")\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Настройка типа памяти и её хранения**  \n",
      "Вы можете дополнительно настроить память, указав параметры `long_term_memory`, `short_term_memory`, и `entity_memory`. Например, для использования SQLite для долговременной памяти и RAG для краткосрочной:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "from crewai.memory import LongTermMemory, ShortTermMemory\n",
      "from crewai.memory.storage.ltm_sqlite_storage import LTMSQLiteStorage\n",
      "from crewai.memory.storage.rag_storage import RAGStorage\n",

      "3. **Использование внешней памяти (например, Mem0 или другие системы)**  \n",
      "Можно подключить внешние системы памяти, задав параметры `memory_config` при создании Crew, например, для Mem0:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "import os\n",
      "from crewai import Crew, Process\n",

      "    memory_config={\n",
      "        \"provider\": \"mem0\",\n",
      "        \"config\": {\"user_id\": \"john\"}\n",
      "    },\n",
      "    verbose=True\n",
      ")\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Обновление и сброс памяти**  \n",
      "Для очистки памяти используйте CLI команду:\n",
      "```bash\n",
      "crewai reset-memories --all\n",
      "```\n",
      "или через API:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "crew.reset_memories(command_type='all')\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Дополнительные рекомендации**  \n",
      "- Используйте переменные окружения для путей и ключей API для безопасности.  \n",
      "- Для более сложных сценариев настройте кастомные хранилища или интеграцию с внешними системами.  \n",
      "- Регулярно проверяйте и обновляйте конфигурацию памяти для оптимальной работы.\n",
      "\n",
      "Если потребуется помощь с конкретной настройкой или примером кода — обращайтесь, я с радостью помогу!\n",
      "\n",

      "Здравствуйте, Алексей!  \n",
      "Благодарю вас за обращение и интерес к возможностям CrewAI. Ниже я подробно объясню, как создать команду (Crew) с включенной памятью и настроить её под ваши нужды.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Создание Crew с активированной памятью  \n",
      "При инициализации Crew укажите параметр `memory=True`. Это активирует встроенную систему памяти, которая по умолчанию использует SQLite для долговременного хранения и встроенные эмбеддинги для краткосрочной памяти.  \n",
      "Пример базовой настройки:  \n",
      "```python\n",
      "from crewai import Crew, Process\n",
      "\n",
      "crew = Crew(\n",
      "    agents=[...],  # ваши агенты\n",
      "    tasks=[...],   # ваши задачи\n",
      "    process=Process.sequential,\n",
      "    memory=True,   # включение памяти\n",
      "    verbose=True\n",
      ")\n",
      "```  \n",
      "\n",
      "2. Настройка типа памяти и её хранения  \n",
      "Вы можете дополнительно настроить типы памяти, указав параметры `long_term_memory`, `short_term_memory` и `entity_memory`. Например, для использования SQLite для долговременной памяти и RAG для краткосрочной:  \n",
      "```python\n",
      "from crewai.memory import LongTermMemory, ShortTermMemory\n",
      "from crewai.memory.storage.ltm_sqlite_storage import LTMSQLiteStorage\n",
      "from crewai.memory.storage.rag_storage import RAGStorage\n",
      "\n",
      "crew = Crew(\n",
      "    agents=[...],\n",
      "    tasks=[...],\n",
      "    process=Process.sequential,\n",
      "    memory=True,\n",
      "    long_term_memory=LongTermMemory(\n",
      "        storage=LTMSQLiteStorage(db_path=\"./memory.db\")\n",
      "    ),\n",
      "    short_term_memory=ShortTermMemory(\n",
      "        storage=RAGStorage(\n",
      "            embedder_config={\n",
      "                \"provider\": \"openai\",\n",
      "                \"config\": {\"model\": \"text-embedding-ada-002\"}\n",
      "            }\n",
      "        ),\n",
      "        type=\"short_term\",\n",
      "        path=\"./\"\n",
      "    ),\n",
      "    entity_memory=RAGStorage(\n",
      "        embedder_config={\n",
      "            \"provider\": \"openai\",\n",
      "            \"config\": {\"model\": \"text-embedding-ada-002\"}\n",
      "        },\n",

      "    verbose=True\n",
      ")\n",
      "```  \n",
      "\n",
      "3. Использование внешней памяти (например, Mem0 или другие системы)  \n",
      "Можно подключить внешние системы памяти, задав параметры `memory_config`. Например, для Mem0:  \n",
      "```python\n",
      "import os\n",
      "from crewai import Crew, Process\n",
      "\n",
      "os.environ[\"MEM0_API_KEY\"] = \"ваш-ключ-API\"\n",
      "\n",
      "crew = Crew(\n",
      "    agents=[...],\n",
      "    tasks=[...],\n",
      "    process=Process.sequential,\n",
      "    memory=True,\n",
      "    memory_config={\n",
      "        \"provider\": \"mem0\",\n",
      "        \"config\": {\"user_id\": \"john\"}\n",
      "    },\n",
      "    verbose=True\n",
      ")\n",
      "```  \n",
      "\n",
      "4. Обновление и сброс памяти  \n",
      "Для очистки памяти используйте команду CLI:  \n",
      "```bash\n",
      "crewai reset-memories --all\n",
      "```  \n",
      "или через API:  \n",
      "```python\n",
      "crew.reset_memories(command_type='all')\n",
      "```  \n",
      "\n",
      "5. Дополнительные рекомендации  \n",
      "- Используйте переменные окружения для путей и API-ключей для повышения безопасности.  \n",
      "- Для более сложных сценариев настройте кастомные хранилища или интеграцию с внешними системами.  \n",
      "- Регулярно проверяйте и обновляйте конфигурацию памяти для оптимальной работы.\n",
      "\n",
      "Если потребуется помощь с конкретной настройкой или примером кода — обращайтесь, я с радостью помогу!  \n",
      "\n",
      "Спасибо за доверие и интерес к CrewAI. Желаю вам успешной работы с памятью и реализации ваших проектов!  \n",
      "\n",
      "С уважением,  \n",

      "\n",
      "Для более подробной информации рекомендуем ознакомиться с официальной документацией по памяти CrewAI: [CrewAI Memory Documentation](https://docs.crewai.com/memory).\u001b[00m\n",

       "Здравствуйте, Алексей!  \n",
       "Благодарю вас за обращение и интерес к возможностям CrewAI. Ниже я подробно объясню, как создать команду (Crew) с включенной памятью и настроить её под ваши нужды.\n",
       "\n",
       "1. Создание Crew с активированной памятью  \n",
       "При инициализации Crew укажите параметр `memory=True`. Это активирует встроенную систему памяти, которая по умолчанию использует SQLite для долговременного хранения и встроенные эмбеддинги для краткосрочной памяти.  \n",
       "Пример базовой настройки:  \n",
       "```python\n",
       "from crewai import Crew, Process\n",
       "\n",
       "crew = Crew(\n",
       "    agents=[...],  # ваши агенты\n",
       "    tasks=[...],   # ваши задачи\n",
       "    process=Process.sequential,\n",
       "    memory=True,   # включение памяти\n",
       "    verbose=True\n",
       ")\n",
       "```  \n",
       "\n",
       "2. Настройка типа памяти и её хранения  \n",
       "Вы можете дополнительно настроить типы памяти, указав параметры `long_term_memory`, `short_term_memory` и `entity_memory`. Например, для использования SQLite для долговременной памяти и RAG для краткосрочной:  \n",
       "```python\n",
       "from crewai.memory import LongTermMemory, ShortTermMemory\n",
       "from crewai.memory.storage.ltm_sqlite_storage import LTMSQLiteStorage\n",
       "from crewai.memory.storage.rag_storage import RAGStorage\n",

       "```  \n",
       "\n",
       "3. Использование внешней памяти (например, Mem0 или другие системы)  \n",
       "Можно подключить внешние системы памяти, задав параметры `memory_config`. Например, для Mem0:  \n",
       "```python\n",
       "import os\n",
       "from crewai import Crew, Process\n",
       "\n",
       "os.environ[\"MEM0_API_KEY\"] = \"ваш-ключ-API\"\n",

       "        \"config\": {\"user_id\": \"john\"}\n",
       "    },\n",
       "    verbose=True\n",
       ")\n",
       "```  \n",
       "\n",
       "4. Обновление и сброс памяти  \n",
       "Для очистки памяти используйте команду CLI:  \n",
       "```bash\n",
       "crewai reset-memories --all\n",
       "```  \n",
       "или через API:  \n",
       "```python\n",
       "crew.reset_memories(command_type='all')\n",
       "```  \n",
       "\n",
       "5. Дополнительные рекомендации  \n",
       "- Используйте переменные окружения для путей и API-ключей для повышения безопасности.  \n",
       "- Для более сложных сценариев настройте кастомные хранилища или интеграцию с внешними системами.  \n",
       "- Регулярно проверяйте и обновляйте конфигурацию памяти для оптимальной работы.\n",
       "\n",
       "Если потребуется помощь с конкретной настройкой или примером кода — обращайтесь, я с радостью помогу!  \n",
       "\n",
       "Спасибо за доверие и интерес к CrewAI. Желаю вам успешной работы с памятью и реализации ваших проектов!  \n",
       "\n",
